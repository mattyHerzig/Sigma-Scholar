description: Each year, the Live Deliberately Essay Contest invites youth around the world, ages 14-18, to consider a selected Henry David Thoreau quotation and accompanying prompt. Contestants are asked to write a thoughtful essay that uses personal experience and observation to demonstrate how that year’s quotation and prompt relate to their own lives and to the world around them. Like Thoreau, these young people use the power of their words to convey vivid stories, personal conviction and human compassion. The essay contest is typically open from mid-November to mid-February and the winners are announced in late April.


The contest has two age groups: 14-16 and 17-18. One winner will be identified in each age group and will receive a $500 cash prize, plus an annotated edition of Walden, autographed by the book’s editor, Jeffrey S. Cramer, our Curator of Collections at The Walden Woods Project’s Library. Essays may also be selected to receive Honorable Mention in each age group, which will be awarded with an autographed annotated edition of Walden. 19-year-olds who are seniors in high school or the equivalent through homeschool or other program at the closing date of the contest are also eligible (college students are ineligible).

description: We do everything we can to make sure that a Hope College experience provides great value at an affordable rate. This focus has earned the College recognition as a Best Value by Kiplinger's Personal Finance and Forbes’ Top Colleges, and inclusion in such books as Colleges That Change Lives and Putting Students First. Our students tell us that the financial aid they received made their dream of attending Hope possible. In its simplest form, eligibility for need-based financial aid can be boiled down to college costs, family contribution and financial need.


Hope honors talented artists in the areas of creative writing, dance, music, theater and the visual arts. You’ll need to audition or submit a portfolio. Incoming first-year students can audition for a Distinguished Artist Award in dance. This award is renewable for up to four years. You must apply to Hope College and submit an audition application to be considered for this scholarship. Students are not required to audition to major or minor in dance, but auditions are required for this award. This scholarship is renewable upon a 2.6 GPA.

description: Each year, the Live Deliberately Essay Contest invites youth around the world, ages 14-18, to consider a selected Henry David Thoreau quotation and accompanying prompt. Contestants are asked to write a thoughtful essay that uses personal experience and observation to demonstrate how that year’s quotation and prompt relate to their own lives and to the world around them. Like Thoreau, these young people use the power of their words to convey vivid stories, personal conviction and human compassion. The essay contest is typically open from mid-November to mid-February and the winners are announced in late April.


The contest has two age groups: 14-16 and 17-18. One winner will be identified in each age group and will receive a $500 cash prize, plus an annotated edition of Walden, autographed by the book’s editor, Jeffrey S. Cramer, our Curator of Collections at The Walden Woods Project’s Library. Essays may also be selected to receive Honorable Mention in each age group, which will be awarded with an autographed annotated edition of Walden. 19-year-olds who are seniors in high school or the equivalent through homeschool or other program at the closing date of the contest are also eligible (college students are ineligible).

description: Full-time students who are a citizen of a Latin American or Caribbean country (including Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands) and who receive scholarships from the federal or state government shall be classified as residents for tuition purposes. This provision of the law provides an opportunity to encourage the continued internationalization of UF and to attract more high-quality students from Latin America and the Caribbean.


To qualify, UF students must be awarded a non-duty scholarship paid from either state funds appropriated to universities in the General Appropriations Act, investment earnings as provided under section 1011.43, Florida Statutes, or from federally authorized scholarship funds. Universities may use equal matching funds from private businesses, private foundations, and public agencies. Students must be full-time and in good academic standing. Graduate or research assistantships are not considered scholarships for this purpose. Note that this program provides eligibility; it is not a guaranteed scholarship. Scholarship decisions are made by the colleges.


The Latin American-Caribbean (LAC) Scholarship may be provided to a student who has dual citizenship between an eligible country and the United States. The LAC award requires full-time enrollment, even in the final semester. LAC award letters must be provided to UFIC each semester in order to receive the change from out of state to in state charges. The LAC award does not require you to be present in the United States.

description: Full-time students who are a citizen of a Latin American or Caribbean country (including Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands) and who receive scholarships from the federal or state government shall be classified as residents for tuition purposes. This provision of the law provides an opportunity to encourage the continued internationalization of UF and to attract more high-quality students from Latin America and the Caribbean.


To qualify, UF students must be awarded a non-duty scholarship paid from either state funds appropriated to universities in the General Appropriations Act, investment earnings as provided under section 1011.43, Florida Statutes, or from federally authorized scholarship funds. Universities may use equal matching funds from private businesses, private foundations, and public agencies. Students must be full-time and in good academic standing. Graduate or research assistantships are not considered scholarships for this purpose. Note that this program provides eligibility; it is not a guaranteed scholarship. Scholarship decisions are made by the colleges.


The Latin American-Caribbean (LAC) Scholarship may be provided to a student who has dual citizenship between an eligible country and the United States. The LAC award requires full-time enrollment, even in the final semester. LAC award letters must be provided to UFIC each semester in order to receive the change from out of state to in state charges. The LAC award does not require you to be present in the United States.

This fund is established in memory of John S. Carasik who was an avid Scottish history fan and an enthusiastic supporter of the preservation of Gylen Castle in his short but fulfilling life.

description: An International GRHS Essay Contest, sponsored by the Germans from Russia Heritage Society, will be held to encourage students to learn about the history and culture of the German-Russians, people who emigrated from Germany into Russia during the 18th and 19th centuries. Today, in the USA, Canada and other countries in the Western Hemisphere, these people have become known as Germans from Russia. 


Contest judging will commence after the close of the Contest on 31 March with the winners being announced after the judging has been completed.  Winning contestants will be invited to receive their awards at a luncheon held in their honor during the Annual GRHS Convention, held in Mandan, North Dakota.


As new generations are born and the older generations vanish, our youth become ever less aware of their cultural and ethnic origins. An important function of GRHS is to stimulate interest and awareness among young people of the dramatic history of the German Russian people. This is important for several reasons. Knowledge of our cultural origins gives us a sense of identity, of belonging and of continuity.


More importantly, an understanding of the lives of our ancestors is an important aspect of decision making in our contemporary world. Although our ancestors lived in a completely different context from our own, many similar societies and cultures still exist. Although many of our ancestors were poor and clung to a much more tenuous existence than we do today, they had the same human needs, emotions and aspirations. Understanding how these were expressed and how lives were managed under extreme circum-stances gives us the strength and understanding to manage our own lives today.

Only one member per immediate family may receive a scholarship during any given academic year. High school seniors are not eligible, as neither are previous Kulze Scholarship recipients.

description: An International GRHS Essay Contest, sponsored by the Germans from Russia Heritage Society, will be held to encourage students to learn about the history and culture of the German-Russians, people who emigrated from Germany into Russia during the 18th and 19th centuries. Today, in the USA, Canada and other countries in the Western Hemisphere, these people have become known as Germans from Russia. 


Contest judging will commence after the close of the Contest on 31 March with the winners being announced after the judging has been completed.  Winning contestants will be invited to receive their awards at a luncheon held in their honor during the Annual GRHS Convention, held in Mandan, North Dakota.


As new generations are born and the older generations vanish, our youth become ever less aware of their cultural and ethnic origins. An important function of GRHS is to stimulate interest and awareness among young people of the dramatic history of the German Russian people. This is important for several reasons. Knowledge of our cultural origins gives us a sense of identity, of belonging and of continuity.


More importantly, an understanding of the lives of our ancestors is an important aspect of decision making in our contemporary world. Although our ancestors lived in a completely different context from our own, many similar societies and cultures still exist. Although many of our ancestors were poor and clung to a much more tenuous existence than we do today, they had the same human needs, emotions and aspirations. Understanding how these were expressed and how lives were managed under extreme circum-stances gives us the strength and understanding to manage our own lives today.

description: MathWorks Math Modeling (M3 Challenge) is a contest for teams of high school juniors and seniors in the U.S. and sixth form students in England and Wales. Through participation in this competition, students experience what it's like to work as a team to tackle a real-world problem under time and resource constraints, akin to those faced by professional mathematicians working in the industry. Teams of 11th and 12th graders from anywhere in the United States, including territories and DoDEA schools, and sixth form students (age 16-19) in England and Wales may participate. The competition is fully virtual, and participants will not be charged a registration or participation fee.


Teams must be comprised of three to five students and one teacher-coach and a maximum of two teams per school may register. Students from dual/joint enrollment programs, magnet programs, and other academic or training programs that draw students from more than one high school for a subset of classes or academic enrichment may be eligible if all of the criteria are met, and at the discretion of SIAM. Homeschool and cyber school students may either form their own team(s) or request to participate on a team at the school in the district or community in which they reside if it meets the SIAM guidelines.

description: A major goal of the Alabama Space Grant Consortium (ASGC) is to develop programs that will help improve the science and mathematics education of all students, and thereby provide a more scientifically literate population. To this end the nation needs an increased supply of students, well-prepared individuals who are fully qualified to teach mathematics and science in our elementary and secondary schools. To encourage talented individuals to pursue studies leading to teaching certification in the sciences and mathematics, the ASGC has established a competitive, undergraduate teacher education scholarship program to complement its existing science and engineering-based scholarships. 


The objective of the Undergraduate Teacher Education Scholarship opportunity is to encourage students pursue degrees leading to become teachers of the sciences and mathematics. The Undergraduate Teacher Education Scholarship applicants must meet the following requirements: applicants must be a US citizen; applicants must have a 3.0 GPA; and applicants must be enrolled as a full-time student (minimum of 12 credit hours) during the upcoming academic year and must be on a track that would qualify them to teach in a pre-college setting. Preference will be given to those majoring in the sciences and mathematics, especially earth, space and environmental science.

description: A college education is already a major financial challenge for most American families, but it becomes infinitely more difficult for a student when a parent dies, leaving little or no life insurance. Recognizing the character and perseverance that so many young people show in the face of such adversity, Life Happens sponsors the annual Life Lessons Scholarship Program for college students and college-bound high school seniors. Qualified entrants who submit essays or videos about how the death of a parent impacted their lives are eligible for scholarship money. Applications are accepted each year from February 1 to March 1. Applicants can be pursuing either an undergraduate or graduate degree.


The Life Lessons Scholarship Program is open only to legal residents of the fifty United States, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, who are between 17 and 24 years of age, have experienced the death of a parent or legal guardian, and are currently enrolled in, or have been accepted to, a college, university or trade school within the fifty United States, the District of Columbia or Puerto Rico. Employees of Life and Health Insurance Foundation for Education (“Life Happens” or “Sponsor”), KWT Global, and their respective parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, and advertising, and promotion agencies, and any such employee’s immediate family members (spouse, parent, child, sibling and their respective spouses) and those living in their same households, whether or not related, are not eligible to enter or win a scholarship.

description: Some of the VFW's earliest ties to the community involve youth groups and perhaps none are stronger or more lasting than the relationship between the VFW and America's scouting organizations. In fact, VFW's partnership with the Boy Scouts of America dates back to 1915 when VFW Post 2100 helped to establish Troop 1 in Everett, Washington. Through the VFW's Scout of the Year program, members of the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts who display standout citizenship, patriotism and love of country have the opportunity to be rewarded with college scholarships. Available only to scouts who are registered, active members of a Boy or Girl Scout Troop, Venturing Crew, or a Sea Scout Ship who have received the Eagle Scout Award, Girl Scout Gold Award, Venture Summit Award or Sea Scout Quartermaster Award. There is no minimum age requirement, but applicants may not be older than 18. Dollar amounts for the scholarship will vary.

description: The Gerald W. & Edith F. Wallace Scholarship will assist students with a physical disability who are from North Dakota farm families. First priority is for students from Burke County, North Dakota. The award amount is based on the student's needs and available funds. The fund was established in 1993 by Mr. Wallace shortly after the death of his wife of nearly 50 years. Mr. Wallace was one of those North Dakotans who, although he had left the state many years ago, never forgot his roots here in North Dakota. 


The North Dakota Community Foundation was formed with that purpose in mind - to create an easy way for North Dakotans to help their neighbors and friends, now and in the future, through charitable giving and promoting philanthropy here at home.  We currently administer over 750 charitable funds, including 69 different community foundations in the state. Our mission is to improve the quality of life for North Dakota's citizens through charitable giving and promoting philanthropy.
