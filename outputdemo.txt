description: Each year, the Live Deliberately Essay Contest invites youth around the world, ages 14-18, to consider a selected Henry David Thoreau quotation and accompanying prompt. Contestants are asked to write a thoughtful essay that uses personal experience and observation to demonstrate how that year’s quotation and prompt relate to their own lives and to the world around them. Like Thoreau, these young people use the power of their words to convey vivid stories, personal conviction and human compassion. The essay contest is typically open from mid-November to mid-February and the winners are announced in late April.


The contest has two age groups: 14-16 and 17-18. One winner will be identified in each age group and will receive a $500 cash prize, plus an annotated edition of Walden, autographed by the book’s editor, Jeffrey S. Cramer, our Curator of Collections at The Walden Woods Project’s Library. Essays may also be selected to receive Honorable Mention in each age group, which will be awarded with an autographed annotated edition of Walden. 19-year-olds who are seniors in high school or the equivalent through homeschool or other program at the closing date of the contest are also eligible (college students are ineligible).

description: We do everything we can to make sure that a Hope College experience provides great value at an affordable rate. This focus has earned the College recognition as a Best Value by Kiplinger's Personal Finance and Forbes’ Top Colleges, and inclusion in such books as Colleges That Change Lives and Putting Students First. Our students tell us that the financial aid they received made their dream of attending Hope possible. In its simplest form, eligibility for need-based financial aid can be boiled down to college costs, family contribution and financial need.


Hope honors talented artists in the areas of creative writing, dance, music, theater and the visual arts. You’ll need to audition or submit a portfolio. Incoming first-year students can audition for a Distinguished Artist Award in dance. This award is renewable for up to four years. You must apply to Hope College and submit an audition application to be considered for this scholarship. Students are not required to audition to major or minor in dance, but auditions are required for this award. This scholarship is renewable upon a 2.6 GPA.

description: Each year, the Live Deliberately Essay Contest invites youth around the world, ages 14-18, to consider a selected Henry David Thoreau quotation and accompanying prompt. Contestants are asked to write a thoughtful essay that uses personal experience and observation to demonstrate how that year’s quotation and prompt relate to their own lives and to the world around them. Like Thoreau, these young people use the power of their words to convey vivid stories, personal conviction and human compassion. The essay contest is typically open from mid-November to mid-February and the winners are announced in late April.


The contest has two age groups: 14-16 and 17-18. One winner will be identified in each age group and will receive a $500 cash prize, plus an annotated edition of Walden, autographed by the book’s editor, Jeffrey S. Cramer, our Curator of Collections at The Walden Woods Project’s Library. Essays may also be selected to receive Honorable Mention in each age group, which will be awarded with an autographed annotated edition of Walden. 19-year-olds who are seniors in high school or the equivalent through homeschool or other program at the closing date of the contest are also eligible (college students are ineligible).
